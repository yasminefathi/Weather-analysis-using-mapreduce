# Weather Analysis Using MapReduce

This project analyzes weather data using the MapReduce programming model. The analysis focuses on temperature trends, precipitation, and other weather metrics over time.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to process large-scale weather data using MapReduce to extract meaningful insights about climate patterns. It aims to provide statistical summaries like average temperatures, rainfall distributions, and seasonal trends for different geographic regions.

## Dataset

- **Data Source**: GHCN-Daily dataset
- **Data Description**: The dataset includes daily weather observations, such as temperature (TMAX, TMIN, TAVG) and precipitation (PRCP). Each record contains information like station ID, date, data type, and value.
- **Data Format**: CSV files with columns:
  - `Station_ID`: Identifier of the weather station.
  - `Date`: Observation date (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - `Data_Type`: Type of measurement (e.g., TMAX, TMIN, PRCP).
  - `Value`: Recorded value for the data type (e.g., temperature in Celsius or precipitation in mm).

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, MapReduce implementation, and results analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample weather data files used in the analysis.
- `output/`: Directory for storing results generated by MapReduce.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw weather data for analysis.
- **MapReduce Implementation**: Custom MapReduce jobs for computing:
  - Average temperature by year or month.
  - Total precipitation over time.
  - Standard deviations, quartiles, and correlation between different weather metrics.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of weather trends using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `mrjob` (for MapReduce)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasminefathi/Weather-analysis-using-mapreduce.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-analysis-using-mapreduce
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the cells to preprocess the data, run the MapReduce jobs, and visualize the results.

## Results

The project outputs include:
- Yearly and monthly average temperatures.
- Insights into rainfall trends and patterns.
- Comparisons of temperature trends between Strasbourg and Tunis.
